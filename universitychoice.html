<br><br>
Experience different universities, explore new cities to discover the kind of environment you could live, study and be happy in. 
And, meet current students, admissions officers and unbiased experts to answer your individual questions and support you with your UK university decision and application. 
<br><br>
You’ll leave GPS feeling reassured, relieved and knowledgeable about the next exciting stage of your life!

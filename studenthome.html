    <div class="EnterpriseProj"><a href="universitychoice"><strong>Choose the Right University</strong></a>
      <p>Your education is one of the biggest investments of your life. Choose correctly and you’re happy, fulfilled, working towards success. Choose incorrectly and you’re miserable, frustrated and unemployable. <br>

      <p>
        Success in life is based on more than academic grades: The ability to work with different people, think independently and solve problems means you bring value to the world. The capacity to embrace new, communicate effectively and present professionally enables you to build strong relationships through life.

<h3><strong>What we ask of GPS Guidance Counselors </strong><h3>
<h4>
	Each Counselor will bring different perspectives and skills to GPS and that's just what we want! However, we ask that every Counselor assists with:
  <ul>
  	<li> Individual student mentoring. Alongside the Life Project workshops, work with individuals and small groups to assist with their project.

    <li> Assist with supervision of the group throughout the programme. We travel a lot and visit a lot of different places. Whilst visiting all of the universities, organisations..we ask Guidance Counselors to work with our 2 Programme Assistants to help supervise students and ensure that the group is safe and happy at all times. 

    <li> Help to deal with any student issues throughout the programme.
  </ul>

   Other tasks that Guidance Counselors can get involved with:
  <ul>
  	<li> Assistance with the Life Project presentations. For example, presenting on: 'Deciding what kind of career is right for you' or 'Specific differences between US and UK education'

    <li> Assistance with the Enterprise Project. For this, students work in small groups to come up with an enterprise plan. Often Counselors can assist students with their project (alongside the workshops)
  </ul>
    If there are other things you would like to be involved with, let us know!

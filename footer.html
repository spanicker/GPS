      <p>Gabriella Holland - Parent<br><br>"As parents, we couldn’t have been happier with the outcome of Finbarr’s trip with Global Paths. It was an incredible opportunity to find out more about University life from the inside. He gained a greater sense of independence and came back with a far better idea of what to study at University and which universities to apply to.""

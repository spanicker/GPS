  <h2 class="title">Refunds</h2>
  When you sign up to the programme, we ask you to pay a non-refundable deposit of £600 to reserve your place. It is non-refundable as it covers the deposits (accommodation, minibus, meals) that we have to make for the course.
  
  <p>If for any reason you cannot attend the programme, we will refund you the full fees, minus the deposit, unless you cancel within 30 days of the programme starting, in which case, unfortunately we cannot refund any of the fees.
